Adopt-A-Pet web app 

This is a responsive web app that helps the user locate adoptable pets in their area. The user simply chooses from cats, dogs, birds, and barnyard from the dropdown menu, and enters their zip code. 

The app returns information 20 cards with the name, age, breed, gender, address, phone number, email, and shelter ID of an animal. The user can click on a card and get more information on that animal, and then click the “Adopt-Me” button to get to the animal’s Petfinder.com profile page. 

The web app uses the petfinder.com API.

Bootstrap was used for the styling, and there is a CSS style sheet.

In order to run the petfinder.com API, several json packages had to be installed.
